# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_
The cartoon of the 3 people overstates certain ethnic/physical features, which could unintentionally suggest hierarchy/ superiority between the shown languages. The data may be misled, as there was no given source, as well as there being different dialects for Chinese. The language chinese is done in billions while the rest of the languages are done in millions which mixes up the units which can be misleading, as well as the fact that the lengths of the bar graphs are not mathematically proportional. 



## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

There is no key so it is unclear what the chart is depicting. Based on the title, it can be inferred that the larger the section, the the larger the total area of each country is. Also, it can be inferred that the darker the color the higher the population density is.


## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

Due to the large quantity of countries shown in the image, it is nearly impossible to interpret the data. A different type of visual would better convey the data which can be done via computer programs. There are also no units on the axes, making the correlation a bit vague. 


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )

```


## Exercise 3
